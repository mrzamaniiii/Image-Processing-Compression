# 📷 Image Processing in MATLAB

This project implements several core techniques in grayscale image processing using MATLAB, including:

- Entropy analysis  
- Histogram equalization  
- Linear image prediction  
- Multi-level low-pass filtering with downsampling  
- JPEG compression assessment using SSIM and PSNR  
- Visualization of SNR and SSIM vs. JPEG quality

## 🧪 Functional Overview

### 1. 🔍 Entropy Analysis
Calculates the entropy of multiple grayscale images to evaluate their information content before and after histogram equalization.

### 2. 🧰 Histogram Equalization
Applies `histeq()` to enhance contrast and observes changes in image histogram and entropy.

### 3. 🧠 Linear Prediction Modeling
Estimates current pixel values using previous neighbors with a 3-coefficient linear model. Computes entropy of the residual (prediction error).

### 4. 🔽 Multi-level Downsampling
Applies a 3x3 average filter followed by `imresize()` (downsampling) across three levels, computing entropy at each level and of the final transmitted image.

### 5. 🗜️ JPEG Compression Evaluation
Saves the image using different JPEG quality settings and evaluates the quality using:
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**

### 6. 📊 Quality Metric Visualization
Plots:
- **Quality vs. SNR**  
- **Quality vs. SSIM**  
For three different test images.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Replace the file paths (`D:\sunset_sparrow.jpg`, etc.) with your own image paths.
2. Run the code in MATLAB section by section.
3. Observe results in the command window and plots.
